A **workspace** is an isolated environment containing all your Fileloom resources. Each workspace has its own templates, files, API keys, team members, and billing.

## Workspace Roles

Team members can have different access levels:

| **Editor** | Create/edit templates, manage files, view API keys |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access to templates and files |

Resources are limited per workspace based on your plan:

| Team Members | 2 | 3 | 5 | 10 |
| Templates | 5 | 50 | Unlimited | Unlimited |

## Deleting a Workspace

<Warning>
  Deleting a workspace permanently removes all templates, files, and API keys. This action cannot be undone.
</Warning>

Only workspace owners can delete a workspace:

1. Go to **Workspace Settings** → **General**
2. Scroll to the danger zone
3. Click **Delete Workspace**
4. Confirm by typing the workspace name

## Best Practices

- **Separate environments** — Create workspaces for development, staging, and production
- **Client isolation** — Use separate workspaces for different clients or projects
- **Team organization** — Group related projects in a single workspace for shared access
