Fileloom maintains a complete version history of your templates, allowing you to track changes and restore previous versions.

## How Versioning Works

### Drafts

- Changes are auto-saved as a draft
- Drafts are **not** available via API
- Only one draft exists at a time (your current work)
- Draft shows as "Current Draft" in version history

### Published Versions

- Created when you click **Publish**
- Each publish creates a new version number
- Published versions are available via API
- All versions are preserved indefinitely

## Version History Panel

Access version history from the template editor:

1. Click the **Version History** button (clock icon)
2. View all versions with timestamps
3. Click any version to preview it

### Version List

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Version** | Version number (v1, v2, v3...) |
| **Published** | When the version was published |
| **Published By** | Team member who published |
| **Status** | Current (active) or Previous |

## Viewing Previous Versions

Click on any version to see:

- HTML content at that version
- CSS content at that version
- Settings at that version
- Preview of the rendered PDF

<Info>
  Viewing a previous version doesn't affect your current draft or the active published version.
</Info>

## Restoring a Version

To restore a previous version:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Version History">
    Click the Version History button in the editor.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Version">
    Click on the version you want to restore.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Restore">
    Click "Restore This Version" to load it into the editor.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Changes">
    The restored content becomes your current draft. Review and make any adjustments.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish">
    Click Publish to make the restored version active. This creates a new version number.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Restoring a version replaces your current draft. If you have unsaved work, save or publish it first.
</Warning>

## Version Comparison

Compare two versions to see what changed:

1. Open Version History
2. Select the first version
3. Click "Compare with..." and select the second version
4. View highlighted differences in HTML, CSS, and settings

## API and Versions

### Default Behavior

API requests use the **latest published version** of a template:
```json
{
  "templateId": "tpl_abc123",
  "templateData": { ... }
}
```

### Current Draft

Drafts are never used by the API. Always publish your template to make changes available.

## Best Practices

### Meaningful Publishes

Don't publish after every small change. Instead:

- Make a series of related changes
- Test thoroughly with different data
- Publish when the template is ready for use

### Document Changes

While Fileloom doesn't have built-in change notes, consider:

- Adding a comment in your HTML: `<!-- v3: Added tax calculation -->`
- Maintaining a changelog in your project documentation

### Test Before Publishing

Always test your template with various data scenarios:

- Empty arrays
- Long text that might wrap
- Missing optional fields
- Edge cases (zero amounts, special characters)

## Version Limits

There are no limits on the number of versions. All published versions are retained for the lifetime of the template.

## Deleting Templates

When you delete a template:

- All versions are permanently deleted
- The template ID becomes invalid
- API requests using that template will fail

<Warning>
  Template deletion cannot be undone. Consider exporting important templates before deletion.
</Warning>

## Exporting Templates

To back up a template:

1. Open the template in the editor
2. Copy the HTML content
3. Copy the CSS content
4. Save both locally or in version control

For programmatic backup, you can fetch template content via the dashboard and store in your own version control system.
