## A

### API Key
A secret credential used to authenticate requests to the Fileloom API. Format: `fl_` followed by a random string. API keys should never be exposed in client-side code.

### Auto Top-Up
A feature that automatically purchases credit packs when your usage reaches a configured threshold, preventing service interruption.

## B

### Billing Period
The recurring time interval for subscription charges. Fileloom offers monthly and annual billing periods, with annual billing providing a 20% discount.

## C

### Credit Pack
A one-time purchase of additional PDF generation credits. Credit packs expire 90 days after purchase and are consumed after monthly quota is exhausted.

### Credits
Units representing the ability to generate PDFs. One credit = one PDF generation. Credits come from either monthly quota (subscription) or purchased credit packs.

## D

### Document ID
A unique identifier assigned to each record in the database. Prefixed by type: `ws_` (workspace), `tpl_` (template), `file_` (file), `key_` (API key), `usr_` (user).

## E

### External Storage
The ability to save generated PDFs to third-party storage providers (AWS S3, Supabase) in addition to or instead of Fileloom's storage.

## F

### FIFO (First In, First Out)
The consumption order for credits. Monthly quota is used first, then the oldest purchased credit pack (by expiration date).

### File Retention
The duration that generated PDFs are stored before automatic deletion. Varies by plan from 7 days (Free) to 365 days (Enterprise).

## G

### Generation Method
How a PDF is created: either from raw `htmlContent` or from a saved `templateId` with `templateData`.

## H

### Handlebars
The templating engine used by Fileloom. Supports variables (`{{name}}`), conditionals (`{{#if}}`), loops (`{{#each}}`), and helper functions.

### Helper Function
A built-in Handlebars function that transforms data. Fileloom provides 70+ helpers for text formatting, math, dates, currency, and more.

### HMAC-SHA256
The cryptographic algorithm used to sign webhook payloads, allowing you to verify that webhooks genuinely came from Fileloom.

## I

### Idempotency
The property where making the same request multiple times produces the same result. Use the `requestId` to track unique generations.

## M

### Margins
The space between page content and the page edge, specified in millimeters. Can be set per-side (top, right, bottom, left).

### Monthly Quota
The number of PDFs included with your subscription plan each month. Resets to full allocation on the 1st of each month.

## O

### Orientation
The page layout direction: `portrait` (taller than wide) or `landscape` (wider than tall).

### Output Name
A Handlebars template for generating dynamic filenames based on template data. Example: `invoice-{{invoiceNumber}}.pdf`

## P

### Page Format
Standard page sizes supported by Fileloom: A0-A6, Letter, Legal, Tabloid, Ledger, or Custom dimensions.

### Plan
A subscription tier that determines your monthly quota, rate limits, and available features. Plans range from Free to Scale Enterprise.

### Polar.sh
Fileloom's payment processor, handling subscriptions and credit pack purchases.

### Print Background
An option that includes background colors and images in the generated PDF. Enabled by default.

## Q

### Quota
See [Monthly Quota](#monthly-quota).

## R

### Rate Limit
The maximum number of API requests allowed per time period. Varies by plan from 10/minute (Free) to unlimited (Enterprise).

### Request ID
A unique identifier assigned to each API request. Format: `req_` followed by timestamp and random string. Used for debugging and support.

### Retention
See [File Retention](#file-retention).

## S

### Signed URL
A temporary URL with embedded authentication that expires after a set time (24 hours for Fileloom). Used for secure file access.

### SLA (Service Level Agreement)
A commitment to uptime availability. Scale plans include SLA guarantees: 99.5% (Scale), 99.9% (Business), 99.99% (Enterprise).

### Storage Mode
Configuration for where generated PDFs are saved:
- `fileloom` - Fileloom storage only (default)
- `external` - External storage only
- `both` - Both Fileloom and external storage

## T

### Template
A reusable HTML document with Handlebars placeholders that can be populated with dynamic data to generate PDFs.

### Template Data
A JSON object containing values to populate template placeholders. Passed via `templateData` in the API request.

### Timeout
The maximum time allowed for PDF generation before the request fails. Varies by plan from 15 seconds (Free) to 300 seconds (Enterprise).

### Twemoji
Twitter's open-source emoji library, automatically injected by Fileloom to ensure consistent emoji rendering across platforms.

## U

### Usage
Metrics tracking your PDF generation activity: PDFs generated, quota consumed, credits used, storage used.

## W

### Webhook
An HTTP callback that Fileloom sends to your server when specific events occur (e.g., PDF generated, PDF failed).

### Webhook Secret
A random string used to sign webhook payloads with HMAC-SHA256. Used to verify webhook authenticity.

### Workspace
The top-level organizational unit in Fileloom. Contains templates, API keys, files, team members, and billing. Each workspace has its own quota and settings.

### Workspace Member
A user with access to a workspace. Roles include:
- **Owner** - Full access, can delete workspace
- **Editor** - Can create/edit templates and generate PDFs
- **Viewer** - Read-only access

## X

### X-API-Key
The HTTP header used to pass your API key for authentication. Alternative: `Authorization: Bearer <api_key>`

### X-Fileloom-Signature
The HTTP header containing the HMAC-SHA256 signature of a webhook payload.
