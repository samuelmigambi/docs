A **workspace** is an isolated environment containing all your Fileloom resources. Each workspace has its own templates, files, API keys, team members, and billing.

## Switching Workspaces

Use the workspace dropdown at the top of the sidebar to switch between workspaces. The dropdown shows:

- Workspace name
- Your role (Owner, Editor, Viewer)
- Settings icon for quick access

    Click the workspace dropdown in the sidebar.

  <Step title="Click Create Workspace">
    Select "Create New Workspace" from the menu.

### General Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Name** | Display name for the workspace |
| **Slug** | URL-friendly identifier |

### Storage Modes

Configure how Fileloom stores your generated PDFs:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Fileloom** | Store in Fileloom storage only (default) |
| **External** | Store in your AWS S3 or Supabase only |
| **Both** | Store copies in both locations |

See [Integrations](/integrations/overview) for external storage setup.

## Workspace Roles

Team members can have different access levels:

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full access, billing management, can delete workspace |
| **Editor** | Create/edit templates, manage files, view API keys |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access to templates and files |

## Workspace Limits

Resources are limited per workspace based on your plan:

| Resource | Free | Starter | Growth | Scale |
|----------|------|---------|--------|-------|
| Team Members | 2 | 3 | 5 | 10 |
| Templates | 5 | 50 | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| API Keys | 1 | 2 | 5 | 10 |
| Retention | 7 days | 30 days | 90 days | 180 days |

## Deleting a Workspace

<Warning>
  Deleting a workspace permanently removes all templates, files, and API keys. This action cannot be undone.
</Warning>

Only workspace owners can delete a workspace:

1. Go to **Workspace Settings** → **General**
2. Scroll to the danger zone
3. Click **Delete Workspace**
4. Confirm by typing the workspace name

## Best Practices

- **Separate environments** — Create workspaces for development, staging, and production
- **Client isolation** — Use separate workspaces for different clients or projects
- **Team organization** — Group related projects in a single workspace for shared access
