    3. Wait for your quota to reset on the 1st of the next month
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I use custom fonts in my PDFs?">
    Yes! You can use any Google Font by including the font link in your HTML. We also auto-inject common fonts (Inter, Roboto, Open Sans) as fallbacks for system fonts that don't exist on our servers.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Why are emojis not rendering correctly?">
    We automatically inject Twemoji for cross-platform emoji support. If you're still having issues, ensure your HTML doesn't block external scripts.

### Templates

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What templating language do you use?">
    We use Handlebars for templating. It supports variables (`{{variable}}`), conditionals (`{{#if}}`), loops (`{{#each}}`), and 70+ built-in helper functions.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I use external images in templates?">
    Yes, you can use any publicly accessible image URL. For best performance, use optimized images and consider base64 encoding for small icons.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I include page numbers?">
    Enable headers/footers in your template settings and use the special classes:
    - `<span class="pageNumber"></span>` - Current page
    - `<span class="totalPages"></span>` - Total pages
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I create multi-page PDFs?">
    Yes! Your content will automatically flow across multiple pages. Use CSS `page-break-before` or `page-break-after` to control where breaks occur.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Credits & Usage

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between quota and credits?">
    **Quota** is your monthly allocation included with your subscription plan. It resets on the 1st of each month.
    
    **Credits** are purchased separately as credit packs. They don't reset monthly but expire 90 days after purchase.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="In what order are quota and credits consumed?">
    We use FIFO (First In, First Out):
    1. Monthly quota is used first
    2. When quota is exhausted, the oldest credit pack is used
    3. When all credits are exhausted, generation fails
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Do unused credits roll over?">
    Monthly quota does NOT roll over - it resets to your plan limit on the 1st.
    
    Credit packs remain valid for 90 days from purchase, regardless of billing cycles.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I set up auto top-up?">
    Go to **Dashboard → Billing → Auto Top-Up** and configure:
    - Which credit pack to purchase
    - Trigger threshold (e.g., when 90% of quota is used)
    - Maximum purchases per month
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

| Error Code | Cause | Solution |
|------------|-------|----------|
| `INVALID_API_KEY` | API key is missing, invalid, or revoked | Check your API key in Dashboard → API Keys |
| `NO_CREDITS_AVAILABLE` | Quota exhausted and no credits | Purchase credits or upgrade plan |
| `TEMPLATE_NOT_FOUND` | Template ID doesn't exist or is inactive | Verify template ID in Dashboard → Templates |
| `TEMPLATE_COMPILATION_ERROR` | Invalid Handlebars syntax | Check template for syntax errors |
| `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` | Generation took too long | Simplify HTML or upgrade for longer timeouts |
| `FILE_TOO_LARGE` | Output PDF exceeds plan limit | Reduce content or upgrade plan |
| `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` | Too many requests | Slow down or upgrade plan |

### PDF Rendering Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Fonts look different than expected">
    System fonts like `-apple-system` or `Segoe UI` don't exist on our Linux servers. Use Google Fonts or our auto-injected fallbacks (Inter, Roboto, Open Sans).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Background colors not appearing">
    Ensure `printBackground: true` is set in your options. This is enabled by default but may be overridden.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Content is cut off">
    Check your margins - content might be extending into the margin area. Also verify your page format matches your content width.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Images not loading">
    - Ensure image URLs are publicly accessible (no authentication required)
    - Use HTTPS URLs
    - Check that images aren't blocked by CORS
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="CSS styles not applying">
    - Avoid CSS `@import` - include all styles inline or in `<style>` tags
    - Some CSS features may not be supported in print context
    - Use `!important` sparingly to override defaults
  </Accordion>
