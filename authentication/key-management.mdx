# Key Management

Proper API key management is essential for security. This guide covers rotation, revocation, and monitoring.

## Viewing Your Keys

In your [dashboard](https://app.fileloom.io), go to **Settings** → **API Keys** to see:

- Key name and prefix (e.g., `fl_live_a1b2...`)
- Permissions granted
- Creation date
- Last used timestamp
- Expiration date (if set)

<Note>
  The full API key is only shown once when created. You can only see the prefix afterward.
</Note>

## Key Rotation

Regularly rotating API keys reduces risk if a key is compromised. Here's how to rotate safely:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a New Key">
    Create a new API key with the same permissions as the old one.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update Your Application">
    Deploy the new key to your application's environment variables.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify It Works">
    Confirm your application is successfully using the new key by checking the "Last Used" timestamp.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Revoke the Old Key">
    Once confirmed, revoke the old key.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Rotation Schedule

| Environment | Recommended Rotation |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Production | Every 90 days |
| Staging | Every 90 days |
| Development | Every 180 days |
| Temporary/Contractor | Set expiration on creation |

## Revoking Keys

Revoke a key immediately if you suspect it's compromised:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to API Keys">
    Navigate to **Settings** → **API Keys**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find the Key">
    Locate the key by its name or prefix.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Revoke">
    Click the **Revoke** button and confirm.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Revocation is immediate and permanent. Any requests using the revoked key will fail instantly.
</Warning>

### When to Revoke

- Key was accidentally committed to a public repository
- Key was exposed in logs or error messages
- Team member with access left the company
- Key was shared insecurely (email, Slack, etc.)
- Suspicious activity detected

## Monitoring Key Usage

Track your API key activity in the dashboard:

### Usage Metrics

- **Total Requests** - All-time request count
- **Successful Requests** - Requests that returned 2xx
- **Failed Requests** - Requests that returned errors
- **Last Used** - Timestamp of most recent request

### Detecting Anomalies

Watch for these warning signs:

| Anomaly | Possible Cause |
|---------|---------------|
| Requests from unexpected IPs | Key may be compromised |
| Spike in failed requests | Integration issue or attack |
| Usage outside business hours | Unauthorized use |
| Requests for unused permissions | Key may be compromised |

## Multiple Keys Strategy

Use multiple API keys to isolate access and reduce blast radius:

  <Card title="Production Key" icon="server">
    **Permissions:**
    - `pdf.generate`
    - `pdf.read`
  </Card>
  <Card title="Staging Key" icon="flask">
    **Permissions:**
    - `pdf.generate`
    - `pdf.read`
    - `template.read`
  </Card>
  <Card title="CI/CD Key" icon="robot">
    **Permissions:**
    - `pdf.read`
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Benefits

- **Isolation** - Compromise of one key doesn't affect others
- **Auditing** - Track usage per environment
- **Least Privilege** - Each key only has needed permissions
- **Easy Rotation** - Rotate one key without affecting others

## Key Limits

Each plan has a maximum number of API keys:

| Plan | Max API Keys |
|------|--------------|
| Free | 1 |
| Starter | 2 |
| Growth | 5 |
| Scale | 10 |
| Scale Business | 25 |
| Scale Enterprise | Unlimited |

## Programmatic Key Management

<Info>
  API key management via API is coming soon. Currently, keys can only be managed through the dashboard.
</Info>

## Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure your API keys are secure:

- [ ] Keys are stored in environment variables, not code
- [ ] Different keys for each environment
- [ ] Keys have minimal required permissions
- [ ] Production keys have no expiration (rotate manually)
- [ ] Temporary keys have expiration dates
- [ ] Old keys are revoked after rotation
- [ ] Key usage is monitored regularly
- [ ] Team has process for compromised keys
