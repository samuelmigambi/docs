## Transferring Ownership

To transfer workspace ownership:

1. Ensure the new owner is already a member
2. Go to **Workspace Settings** → **Members**
3. Click on the member to become owner
4. Select "Transfer Ownership"
5. Confirm the transfer

You'll become an Editor after transferring ownership.

## Best Practices

- **Least privilege** — Assign the minimum role needed for each member's tasks
- **Review regularly** — Periodically audit member access
- **Remove promptly** — Remove members who no longer need access
- **Document ownership** — Ensure multiple people can access critical workspaces
