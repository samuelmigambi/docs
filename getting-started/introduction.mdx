# What is Fileloom?

Fileloom is a developer-first PDF generation API that lets you create beautiful, professional PDFs from HTML templates. Whether you need to generate invoices, reports, certificates, or any other document, Fileloom handles the complexity so you can focus on building your product.

## The Problem

Generating PDFs programmatically is painful:

- **Puppeteer/Playwright** - Complex setup, resource-heavy, difficult to scale
- **wkhtmltopdf** - Outdated rendering, inconsistent results
- **Native libraries** - Low-level APIs, steep learning curve
- **Self-hosted solutions** - Infrastructure overhead, maintenance burden

## The Solution

Fileloom provides a simple API that:

1. **Accepts HTML** - Use the web technologies you already know
2. **Returns PDFs** - High-quality, print-ready documents
3. **Scales automatically** - From 100 to 1,000,000+ PDFs per month
4. **Handles the complexity** - Fonts, page breaks, headers, footers - all handled
