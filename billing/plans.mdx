## How Credits Work

### Consumption Order (FIFO)

Fileloom uses your quota first, then credits:
```
PDF Request
    ↓
1. Monthly quota remaining?
   → Yes: Use quota
   → No: Continue to step 2
    ↓
2. Credit packs available?
   → Yes: Use oldest pack first (FIFO)
   → No: Return error (429)
```

**FIFO (First In, First Out):** When consuming credits, Fileloom automatically uses the pack that expires soonest, ensuring you never lose purchased credits.

### Example Scenario

You're on the Growth plan (10,000 PDFs/month) and purchased a Business pack:

| Source | Available | Expires |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Monthly Quota | 10,000 | End of month |
| Business Pack | 5,000 | 90 days |
| **Total** | **15,000** | — |

When you generate PDFs:
1. First 10,000 use your monthly quota
2. Next 5,000 use your credit pack
3. After 15,000, API returns quota exceeded error

## Purchasing Credits

### From Dashboard

1. Go to **Settings** → **Billing**
2. Click **Buy Credits**
3. Select a credit pack
4. Complete payment

Credits are available immediately after purchase.

### Via API (Coming Soon)

Programmatic credit purchases will be available in a future update.

---

## Auto Top-Up

Never run out of credits with automatic purchases when your balance is low.

### Setting Up Auto Top-Up

1. Go to **Settings** → **Billing** → **Auto Top-Up**
2. Enable auto top-up
3. Configure:
   - **Pack to purchase**: Which credit pack to buy
   - **Trigger**: When to purchase (percentage or absolute)
   - **Monthly limit**: Maximum auto-purchases per month

### Configuration Options

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Pack | Which credit pack to auto-purchase | Business |
| Trigger Type | `percentage` or `absolute` | percentage |
| Trigger Value | When to trigger (e.g., 90% used or 1000 remaining) | 90 |
| Include Credits | Count existing credits in trigger calculation | No |
| Max Per Month | Safety limit on auto-purchases | 5 |
| Notify On Purchase | Email when auto-purchase occurs | Yes |
| Notify On Failure | Email if purchase fails | Yes |

### Example Configuration
```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "packName": "Business Pack",
  "packPdfs": 5000,
  "packPrice": 4500,
  "triggerType": "percentage",
  "triggerValue": 90,
  "maxTriggersPerMonth": 5,
  "notifyOnPurchase": true
}
```

This configuration:
- Purchases a Business Pack (5,000 PDFs)
- When 90% of quota is used
- Maximum 5 times per month
- Sends email notification on purchase

<Warning>
Auto top-up requires a valid payment method on file. Failed payments disable auto top-up after 3 consecutive failures.
</Warning>

## Viewing Credit Balance

### Dashboard

Your credit balance appears in multiple locations:

- **Top navigation**: Quick view of total available
- **Billing page**: Detailed breakdown by source
- **Usage page**: Historical consumption chart

### API Response

Every PDF generation response includes usage data:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { ... },
  "usage": {
    "remaining": 12500,
    "quotaUsed": 7500,
    "quotaLimit": 10000
  }
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `remaining` | Total PDFs available (quota + credits) |
| `quotaUsed` | Monthly quota consumed |
| `quotaLimit` | Monthly quota limit from plan |

---

## Credit Expiration

### 90-Day Validity

Credit packs expire 90 days from purchase, regardless of:
- Billing cycle changes
- Plan upgrades or downgrades
- Subscription cancellation

### Expiration Warnings

Fileloom sends notifications before credits expire:

| Warning | Timing |
|---------|--------|
| First notice | 14 days before |
| Second notice | 7 days before |
| Final notice | 1 day before |

### What Happens at Expiration

- Remaining PDFs in the pack are forfeited
- Pack is marked as `expired`
- Lifetime stats updated with expired count
- No refunds for expired credits

<Tip>
Purchase credits when you have a specific need rather than stockpiling. The 90-day window provides flexibility without long-term commitment.
</Tip>

## Credit History

View your complete credit history in **Settings** → **Billing** → **Credit History**.

Each entry shows:

| Field | Description |

## Credits vs Plan Upgrade

When should you buy credits vs upgrade your plan?

### Buy Credits When:

- **Temporary spike** - One-time project or seasonal demand
- **Testing capacity** - Evaluating higher usage before committing
- **Buffer needed** - Want safety margin without monthly commitment
- **Near cycle end** - Only need extra capacity for a few days

### Upgrade Plan When:

- **Consistent growth** - Regularly exceeding quota
- **Need features** - Want capabilities only in higher tiers
- **Cost efficiency** - Monthly average exceeds credit pack value
- **Team scaling** - Need more members or API keys

### Cost Comparison Example

If you consistently need 15,000 PDFs/month:

| Option | Monthly Cost |
|--------|--------------|
| Growth ($49) + Business Pack ($45) | $94 |
| Scale Plan ($199) | $199 |

In this case, credits are more economical. But Scale includes 50,000 PDFs, priority support, and 99.5% SLA.
