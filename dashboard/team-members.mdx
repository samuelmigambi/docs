## Best Practices

- **Least privilege** — Assign the minimum role needed for each member's tasks
- **Review regularly** — Periodically audit member access
- **Remove promptly** — Remove members who no longer need access
- **Document ownership** — Ensure multiple people can access critical workspaces
